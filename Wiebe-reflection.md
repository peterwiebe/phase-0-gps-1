#GPS 1.1 Version Control & Git

* *What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
The one issue that I was kind of confused about was creating a new branch. I didn't quite understand why the command was git checkout, didn't really fit the description. I have since learned that to create a new branch is git branch branch-name. Git checkout is to switch to an existing branch and checkout -b creates a new branch and checks it out at the same time.
* *What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
Clearing of merge conflicts became more clear, that was something that I had stumbled upon before DBC. I did not realize that the top portion to a git conflict was the branch that was being merged to and that the bottom section was the incoming branch that was being added.
Also, fetching and merging locally makes sense after this GPS.
* *What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
There weren't any real big questions that we asked our guide, the one that stuck out most was why we were asked to use touch inside of our challenges instead of using the subl command inside the Terminal.
* *What still confuses you about git?*
I think its just the more advance items, I am trying to understand the idea behind a rebase. I intend to spend more time figuring it out.
* *How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
This was both my first pairing and first guided pairing and it went well, I thought. Ronny was helpful when I got stuck and positive when supporting me through my turn as the driver. When it was his turn to Drive he made sure to include me as we finished off the releases. Gary was great in guiding us through, giving us some tips along the way. He did a great job of clarifying the process and what to expect going forward.
